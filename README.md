# ansible_machines (Work in Progress)
My Setup for machines from Base/Server/Desktop

## Setup
* Each machine should have git installed on it.
```bash
sudo apt install git
```
* If non-enterprise or a local machine, ansible will need to be installed on it.
```bash
sudo apt install ansible
```
* Ansible Playbook is used to push out configs to all hosts
```bash
ansible-playbook example/file.yml
```
* Ansible Pull is used to pull configs from GitHub and configure machines.
```bash
ansible pull git@hub:url.git
```
